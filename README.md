# InputImpedance-Variation
This contains a project on Wave transmission where variation of Input Impedance is studied by varying various parameters.

Problem Statement: Consider a plane wave (having angular frequency of  rad/sec and phase constant of 
rad/m) propagating along a transmission line and terminated by a load impedance ZL. The
transmission line has a characteristic impedance of Zo (=Ro + jXo) and length of l. Plot the input
impedance Zi of the transmission line for different values of the load impedance ZL (=RL + jXL). Note:
the parameter l should be considered as input in terms of . The parameter values , , l, R0, X0, RL,
XL will be provided from user-end.
